JOURNEY

Monocarp decided to embark on a long hiking journey.

He decided that on the first day he would walk a kilometers, on the second day he would walk b kilometers, on the third day he would walk c kilometers, on the fourth day, just like on the first, he would walk a kilometers, on the fifth day, just like on the second, he would walk b kilometers, on the sixth day, just like on the third, he would walk c kilometers, and so on.

Monocarp will complete his journey on the day when he has walked at least n kilometers in total. Your task is to determine the day on which Monocarp will complete his journey.

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing four integers n, a, b, c (1≤n≤109; 1≤a,b,c≤106).

Output
For each test case, output one integer — the day on which Monocarp will have walked at least n kilometers in total and will complete his journey.
